I was playing with noise functions, and combined circular rotation with a circular pattern, making a shape where lines stick out from an outline of a circle. Each line has a unique position, length, and rotation, and yet, the entire shape retains a distinct "shape" across all 360 degrees, with the lines inverting at 180 degrees.
